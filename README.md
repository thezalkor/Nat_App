Goal 1: Take a weight (in kilograms) and have a historical list of all the weights along with the date of when the weight was entered in the app. Then take those weights and create a Growth chart that can be displayed to get a sense of the growth trend. 
Goal 2: Have a user be able to input medications. The data that needs to be captured here is the name of the medication ( generic and actual name), strength and dosage, pharmacy, when it was filled and needs a refill, and finally how many refills remain. 
An optional objective here would be to provide a little description of each medication but I do not see this as necessary at this point in time, since this is for personal use for my daughter and we already know what all of her medications do. 
Goal 3: (optional for this class but will be a future goal after the class is completed) Have the application be able to check when the refill date for each medication is due and email myself a reminder so that we can call the pharmacy. Each medication has different times when we have to call them in. 
Goal 4: Create a contact list with names of daughter’s physicians, support coordinators, and therapists etc… This would be a simple contact list where we can quickly get a phone number or email when we need to reach out to someone in particular.
